The single sorts propagate fast enough by the seeds, the sort with double flowers never produces any, so is only propagated by parting of the roots; the best time for this is in autumn, after their flowers are past; in doing of this, every head which can be slipped off with roots should be parted; these should be planted in a border of fresh undunged earth, at the distance of six inches, observing to water them gently until they have taken root, after which they will require no more, for much wet is injurious to them, as is also dung.

The Chinese call it Santanhoa; with them it produces flowers and fruit the year through, and they hold the blossoms in such veneration, as to use them in the sacrifices they make to their idol Ixora, whence Linnæus has taken the name applied by him to this genus. The root is said to possess some acrimony, and to be made use of by the natives in curing the toothach.\nIt is customary in this country, to treat the Ixora as a stove plant; perhaps it may be less tender than we are aware of; it flowers in July and August, but has not been known to produce fruit; is increased from cuttings, without much difficulty.\nOur drawing was taken from a small but very healthy plant in the stove of Mr. Whitley (late Thoburn and Whitley, Brompton).\nLinnæus describes, and some authors figure this plant with stipulæ, which our plant had not, not being arrived at an age, perhaps, to produce them.","pages":[],"species":[]},{"id":170,"latinName":"Draba Aizoides","genus":114,"commonName":"Sengreen Draba or","slug":"draba-aizoides","volume":5,"datePublished":1791,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19123/19123-h/19123-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":571,"type":"jpg","name":"170_draba_aizoides.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Whitlow-Grass","class":22,"order":243,"genericCharacters":["Generic Character.Silicula integra, ovali-oblonga: valvis planiusculis, dissepimento\nparallelis.

Dodonæus; of the second, and third, he takes no notice.\nThe two former ones of these have the greatest affinity, inasmuch as they both produce for the most part only one flower, of a white colour, having a very short nectary, edged with orange; to both of these Linnæus's specific description is equally applicable, as well as the trivial name of poeticus, given them indiscriminately by several of the old Botanists, some regarding the first, some the second as the plant mentioned by Theocritus[2], Virgil[3], and Ovid[4]; unfortunately both of them are found to grow in the same meadows, and have the same obvious appearances, it is therefore utterly impossible to say which of the two was the Narcissus of the poets; if we have the greatest difficulty in ascertaining what the plants were of the Botanists of those times, how are we to discover what the Poets meant, who with very few exceptions have been unpardonably inattentive to the appearances of nature. Since then the term poeticus is equally suitable to both, and as there cannot be two with the same name, we have thought it best to get rid of it altogether, and substitute others which tend in a certain degree to discriminate the several species, denominating the 1st. angustifolius. 2d. majalis. 3d. biflorus. The angustifolius here figured is a native of the South of Europe, and said by Magnol and Clusius to grow spontaneously in the meadows about Narbonne and Montpelier.\nIt flowers in our gardens early in April, about a month before the biflorus, and full six weeks sooner than the majalis, increases readily by offsets, and succeeds best in a soil that is moderately moist. In what respects it differs from the two others, will be mentioned when they come to be figured.","pages":[],"species":[6,15,78,88,121,48,51,197]},{"id":194,"latinName":"Fritillaria Imperialis","genus":151,"commonName":"Crown Imperial","slug":"fritillaria-imperialis","volume":6,"datePublished":1793,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21843/21843-h/21843-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":670,"type":"jpg","name":"194_fritillaria_imperialis.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Hexandria Monogynia","class":6,"order":1,"genericCharacters":["Cor. 6-petala, campanulata, supra ungues cavitate nectarifera.\nStam. longitudine corollæ."],"synonyms":["FRITILLARIA imperialis racemo comoso inferne nudo, foliis\nintegerrimis.

E. Smith, who received them from Madrid, to which place they were sent from South-America, and where the plant as Mons. Cavanille informs us, grows spontaneously near Mexico. In October 1793, we had the pleasure of seeing the plant again in blossom in the aforesaid garden, raised from seeds which ripened there the preceding year, but unfortunately from the lateness of their flowering, and the very great injury the plants had sustained from the Cobweb Mite (Acarus teliarius) vulgarly called the red Spider, there seemed little prospect that the seed-vessels would arrive at perfection.\nThe seeds were sown by Mr. Fairbairn, in March, and the plants kept in the green-house till very late in the summer, when to accelerate their blowing, they were removed into the dry stove: it is worthy of remark, that these plants, even late in the autumn, shew no signs of blossoming, but the flowers at length come forth with almost unexampled rapidity, and the seed-vessels are formed as quickly, so that if the flowers were not very numerous, their blossoming period would be of very short duration; future experience may perhaps point out the means of making the plant blow earlier: in Spain, the blossoms appeared later than here, Mons. Cavanille observed them in the Royal Garden, in November and December, most probably in the open ground, as no mention is made of the plants having been preserved from the weather.\nIt was not till long after our description was taken, that we had an opportunity of seeing Mons. Cavanille's most accurate and elegant work, above quoted, in which this plant is first figured and described; we have selected the most essential parts of his generic character, and adopted his specific description: there is one point, however, in which we differ from him; the part which he regards as the fifth Petal, we are inclined to consider rather as that indescribable something, called by Linnæus the Nectary, it is indeed of little moment whether we call it a Petal or a Nectary, but there are several reasons why, strictly speaking, we cannot regard it as a Petal: in general the number of Petals correspond with the number of the leaves of the Calyx, those of the latter are four; the base of this Nectary originates deeper than the claws of the Petals, springing in fact from the same part as the Filament, its structure, especially the lower part of it, is evidently different from that of the Petals, corresponding indeed as nearly as possible with that of the base of the filament.—Vid.

With double flowers. 2. With flowers blotched with purple. 3. With striped leaves, or leaves edged with yellow. The two first of these are to be esteemed merely as curiosities; in the third the plant acquires an accession of beauty which it has not originally; though many persons object to variegated leaves, as conveying an idea of fickliness, that complaint cannot be urged against the foliage of the striped Lily, to which the borders of the flower-garden are indebted for one of their chief ornaments during the autumnal and winter months; early in September these begin to emerge, and towards spring another set rises up in their centre, of more upright growth, and which announce the rising of the flowering stem.\nBesides these varieties, Linnæus has considered the Lilium album floribus dependentibus s. peregrinum of C. Bauhine, the Sultan Zambach of Clusius, and the Hortus Eystettensis, as one of its varieties also: Miller regards this plant as a distinct species, and those who have attentively examined the figures and descriptions of Clusius and the Hort. Eyst. will be of the same opinion.\nThe Lily increases most abundantly by offsets, hence it becomes necessary that the bulbs should be taken up, and reduced every second or third year; but the striped leaved variety increasing much more slowly, should remain unmolested for a greater length of time.\nThere is scarcely a soil or situation in which the Lily will not grow, it will thrive most in a soil moderately stiff and moist; though a native of a warm climate no severity of weather affects it with us: we may learn from this, not to regulate the culture of plants invariably by the climate in which they grow spontaneously.\nThe best time for removing the bulbs of this plant is about the middle of August, before they shoot forth their leaves; but they may be transplanted any time from September to spring.","pages":[],"species":[30,36,259]},{"id":279,"latinName":"Plumeria Rubra","genus":169,"commonName":"Red Plumeria","slug":"plumeria-rubra","volume":8,"datePublished":1794,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":651,"type":"jpg","name":"279_plumeria_rubra.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Pentandria Monogynia","class":5,"order":1,"genericCharacters":["Contorta.

Hale, of Alton, Hants, who resided at Halifax in Nova-Scotia several years, brought me some seeds of it gathered in that neighbourhood, which vegetated, and produced flowering plants: it is not new to this country, being known to Morison who figures it, and to Miller, who cultivated it in 1731.\nIt is a hardy perennial plant, growing to about the height of a foot and a half, or two feet, and flowering from the beginning of July, to September; it has a creeping root, thereby it increases greatly in light dry soils, and warm situations, so as even to be troublesome; it will not thrive in a wet soil; with us it produces seed-vessels but rarely; is propagated by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring; Miller recommends March as the most proper season, or it may be raised from seeds, which in certain situations and seasons ripen here.\nThe flowers of this Apocynum have a sweet honey-like fragrance, which perfumes the air to a considerable distance, and no doubt operates powerfully in attracting insects; when a plant of this sort is fully blown, one may always find flies caught in its blossoms, usually by the trunk, very rarely by the leg; sometimes four, or even five, which is the greatest possible number, are found in one flower, some dead, others endeavouring to disentangle themselves, in which they are now and then so fortunate as to succeed; these flies are of different species, the musca pipiens, a slender variegated fly with thick thighs, is a very common victim, the musca domestica, or house fly, we have never observed among the captives.\nPrevious to our explaining the manner in which it appears to us that these insects are caught, it will be necessary that we should describe, in as plain a manner as possible, those parts of the flower which more particularly constitute this fatal fly trap.\nOn looking into the flower we perceive five Stamina, the Antheræ of which are large, of a yellow colour, and converge into a kind of cone; each of these Antheræ is arrow-shaped, towards the top of the cone their sides touch but do not adhere, below they separate a little, so as to leave a very narrow opening or slit between each, they are placed on very short filaments, which stand so far apart that a considerable opening is left between them, which openings, however, are closed up by processes of the corolla, nicely adapted to, and projecting into them; at the bottom of, and in the very centre of the flower, we perceive two germina, or seed-buds, the rudiments of future seed-vessels, surrounded by glandular substances, secreting a sweet liquid; on the summit of these germina, and betwixt the two, stands the stigma, in the form of a little urn, the middle of which is encircled by a glandular ring, which secretes a viscid honey-like substance, to this part of the stigma the Antheræ interiorly adhere most tenaciously, so as to prevent their separation unless considerable force be applied; it is, as we apprehend, the sweet viscid substance thus secreted by the stigma, within the Antheræ, which the fly endeavours to obtain, and to this end insinuates its trunk first into the lowermost and widest part of the slit, betwixt each of the Antheræ above described, pushing it of necessity upwards: when gratified, not having the sense to place itself in the same position as that in which it stood when it inserted its trunk, and to draw it out in the same direction downwards, unfortunately for it, it varies its position, and pulling its trunk upwards, draws it into the narrow part of the slit, where it becomes closely wedged in, and the more it pulls the more securely it is caught, and thus this heedless insect, as Thomson calls it, terminates its existence in captivity most miserable.\nIn the incomparable poem of Dr. Darwin, entitled the Botanic Garden, there is a figure given of this plant; and in the Supplement we have the following account written by Mr. Darwin, of Elston.\"In the Apocynum Androsæmifolium the Anthers converge over the nectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles, surrounding the germ, and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the interstice between each anther; but when a fly inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and with such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes.\"This explanation of a phænomenon entitled to much attention, is widely different from ours; which of the two is most consonant to truth and nature, we shall leave to the determination of future observers.\nIn explaining the preceding appearances, to prevent confusion we called those parts which form the cone in the middle of the flower Antheræ, but strictly speaking they are not such, the true Antheræ being situated on the inside of their summits, where they will be found to be ten in number, making in fact the Apocynum a decandrous plant.","pages":[],"species":[]},{"id":281,"latinName":"Turnera Angustifolia","genus":171,"commonName":"Narrow-Leav'd Turnera","slug":"turnera-angustifolia","volume":8,"datePublished":1794,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":739,"type":"jpg","name":"281_turnera_angustifolia.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Pentandria Trigynia","class":5,"order":3,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus, infundibuliformis, exterior 2-phyllus.

In 1788, Mr. Walter published his Fl. Carolin. in which he describes a second species of Hydrangea, which he calls radiata,[2] having very distinctly, as in the Viburnum, two different kinds of florets in the same Cyma, this variation in the florets is added by him to the generic character: the similarity which exists between the flowers of Mr. Walter's Hydrangea radiata, and those of the present plant sufficiently justify Dr. Smith in making it an Hydrangea; the appearances observed by Loureiro[3] on dissecting the germen, and our discovery of the existence of two different kinds of flowers in the Hydrangea arborescens, tend still more to confirm its propriety; we may add, that in the very habit of these several plants there exists a considerable similarity; still, however, it is only by ripe seed-vessels of the present plant, that this doubtful matter can be satisfactorily cleared up; but it will not follow, that if it be not an Hydrangea it must be a Viburnum.\nThis magnificent and highly ornamental plant, according to Dr. Smith, was introduced from China to the royal garden at Kew, by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. in 1790; it was imported by Mr. Slater about the same time, with whom it is said to have first flowered in this country.\nIf room were allowed us, it would be superfluous to describe minutely a plant now so very common; suffice it to say, that from a strong perennial root, rise a number of half-shrubby, irregular, somewhat spongy stalks, strongly spotted when young with purple, from one to three feet high, terminated by large bunches of flowers, at first green, then rose-coloured, and finally green a second time; these are the most common changes to which they are liable: but it will sometimes happen that a plant which has produced red flowers one year, shall produce blue another, though growing in the same pot; this we saw happen in the year 1796 to a plant in the possession of the Countess of Upper Ossory, whose refined taste and superior judgment have in several instances contributed to render our works more acceptable to the public: the coloured changeable part of the flower is regarded as the calyx, in the centre of which is the corolla, containing the stamina, &c. all varying greatly in point of number; besides these, there are other flowers without any calyx, but the parts which they contain do not seem to be more perfect than those of the others, nor more productive of ripe fruit.\nSince the introduction of this plant, trials have been made in regard to its hardiness, and it is found to survive mild winters if planted in very warm sheltered situations; but in others, both stalks and leaves are liable to be killed by slight frosts, though the roots are not; if persons are anxious to have it in the open border, the best mode will be to cut down the stems at the approach of winter, and cover over the root with rotten tan, or some light substance; in the spring fresh stalks will shoot forth, but it is more common to keep this plant during winter in a green-house or well secured frame; by artificial heat it may be brought to flower in April or May, without such, it begins to blossom about June, and continues in bloom till October; when successfully treated, it will acquire the height of three feet, and produce bunches of flowers supremely magnificent: such plants in pots are admirably adapted for decorating court-yards, balconies, &c. unless carefully cut in, it is apt to grow too large for the green-house, therefore it is proper to have a succession of young plants from cuttings, which strike very freely; this plant loves water, is indeed almost an aquatic, a rich soil, and plenty of pot room.","pages":[],"species":[437]},{"id":439,"latinName":"Illicium Floridanum","genus":179,"commonName":"","slug":"illicium-floridanum","volume":13,"datePublished":1799,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43858/43858-h/43858-h.htm#plate_439","image":{"height":1000,"width":833,"type":"jpg","name":"439_illicium_floridanum.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Polyandria Polygynia","class":13,"order":13,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 6-phyllus.

They are placed alternately on the branches, are of a thick consistence, smooth, and of a fine deep green colour. These leaves in well-sheltered places remain until the spring before they fall off, so that this plant may not improperly be planted among the Evergreens, especially as the young shoots are always of a strong green. The flowers are yellow, and do not possess the fragrance of the common Jasmine. They are produced chiefly in June, and the blow is soon over. They are succeeded by berries, which when ripe are black, whence its name of Berry-bearing Jasmine.

Pl. rar. gives an accurate description and good figure of the present plant, before unnoticed (as he observes) by any author; it has since been particularly described by Haller and Jacquin; the former makes a distinct genus of it, by the name of Polygaloides.\nIt is an elegant little evergreen shrub of low growth, rarely exceeding a foot in height, with leaves like those of box, producing flowers from May to October, but most plentifully in May and June; each flower stands on a peduncle proceeding from a kind of triphyllous cup, formed of floral leaves, the true calyx is composed of three leaves, which are nearly white; the two outermost petals, similar to the wings of a papilionaceous flower, are also white, or nearly so; the third petal which forms a kind of tube and contains the eight stamina with the pistillum, is white at the base, but yellow towards the extremity, where it changes by degrees to a bright bay colour: both Clusius and Jacquin observed a variety of this plant, in which the calyx and wings were of a beautiful purple; this variety, we believe, has not yet been introduced to this country: the common sort was cultivated in the garden at Oxford, in 1658.\nMiller describes it as a plant difficult of cultivation; it is not now regarded as such; both Clusius and Jacquin describe it as having creeping roots; such plants are generally increased without difficulty, and so is this; planted in bog earth on a shady border, it thrives extremely well, and spawns much, so that there is no necessity for having recourse to its seeds. It grows spontaneously on the Alps of Austria and Switzerland.","pages":[],"species":[]},{"id":317,"latinName":"Ononis Fruticosa","genus":206,"commonName":"Shrubby Rest-Harrow","slug":"ononis-fruticosa","volume":9,"datePublished":1795,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38382/38382-h/38382-h.htm#plate_317","image":{"height":1459,"width":894,"type":"jpg","name":"317_ononis_fruticosa.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Diadelphia Decandria","class":17,"order":10,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-partitus: laciniis linearibus.

Parkinson, who cultivated it in 1629, informs us that he received plants of it from France for his garden, and that \"it groweth neere the river of Canada, where the French plantation in America is seated.\"It is a hardy herbaceous plant, growing in favourable situations to the height of three or four feet; the main spike of flowers which terminates the stalk, is often a foot in length; by the time that most of its flowers are blown, side branches shoot out, and flower; so that the plant continues in bloom six weeks or two months: if the Autumn prove favourable, the plant with us produces plenty of seed in the open ground; to insure its ripening, some place pots of it, when blowing, in the greenhouse or stove.\nBeautiful and hardy as this plant is, and long as it has been introduced to this country, we do not find it generally in gardens; we attribute this to its having, in a greater degree than many other plants, a partiality for a particular soil; in certain districts, where the soil is stiff and moist, it grows as freely as any weed, in other soils it is perpetually going off: it is also one of those plants whose roots require to be often parted; if this be done every Autumn, and they be planted in a stiff loam, the situation somewhat moist and shady, this very desirable plant may be had to grow and blossom in perfection.\nIt flowers from the latter end of July to October.\nIs increased by parting its roots, by cuttings of the stalk and from seed.","pages":[],"species":[225]},{"id":321,"latinName":"Cotyledon Orbiculata","genus":209,"commonName":"Round-Leaved\nNavel-Wort","slug":"cotyledon-orbiculata","volume":9,"datePublished":1795,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38382/38382-h/38382-h.htm#plate_321","image":{"height":860,"width":506,"type":"jpg","name":"321_cotyledon_orbiculata.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Decandria Pentagynia","class":10,"order":5,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus.

Pl. in his Mantissa he describes it more minutely, and changes it to the Genus Manulea, first established by him in the said work; he observes, that in this species the corolla is more regular than in the others.\nMr. Aiton regards it as a biennial, its stalk is a foot or a foot and a half high, and woolly, its branches are opposite, not alternate as Linnæus describes them; in this perhaps they may vary; leaves opposite, sessile, obovate, narrowing to the base, toothed on the edge, edge rolled back a little in the young leaves, flowers grow in a long thyrsus, from two to five proceed from one common short peduncle; they are at first lemon-coloured, or greenish yellow, finally deep orange; Linnæus says the whole of the plant except the corolla is woolly, the tube of that even is hairy, the segments are smooth, with their edges rolled back, the upper part of the tube in which the stamina are included is dilated somewhat, as is also the lower part, so that it is narrowest in the middle. The flowers which make their appearance from May to November are usually succeeded by seeds, by which the plant is propagated.\nIt is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. Aiton, was introduced by Mr. Masson, in 1774.\nThe blossoms have a singular but unpleasant smell, not perceivable at a distance.\nThe variety of pleasant colours so conspicuous in the flowers, renders this rare plant desirable to such as aim at a general collection.","pages":[],"species":[]},{"id":323,"latinName":"Rubus Odoratus","genus":73,"commonName":"Flowering Raspberry","slug":"rubus-odoratus","volume":9,"datePublished":1795,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38382/38382-h/38382-h.htm#plate_323","image":{"height":860,"width":506,"type":"jpg","name":"323_rubus_odoratus.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Icosandria Polygynia","class":12,"order":13,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus.

Corn. Canad. 149. t. 150.\nBotanists and Gardeners have given to this species of Rubus the name of flowering, not because it is the only one which produces flowers, but from its being regarded for its flowers merely; they indeed are so shewy, and so plentifully produced, that the plant has long been thought to merit a place in most shrubberies; to the various inhabitants of which, both in the largeness and elegant form of its leaves, and the colour of its blossoms, it forms a pleasing contrast.\nIt is extremely hardy, and easily propagated by suckers; the only care which it requires, is to keep it within proper bounds: young plants of it produce the largest and finest flowers.\nIt blossoms from June to September, is a native of different and distant parts of North-America, and was cultivated here by Mr. Miller, in 1739.\nCornutus, who first figured and described this plant, gave it the name of odoratus, on account of the fragrance of its foliage; his words are \"elegantissimi hujus folia fragrantissima sunt, paremque agrimonio odorato spirant odorem;\" the fruit, rarely produced with us, he observes, is like the common Raspberry, but not so pleasant.","pages":[],"species":[132]},{"id":324,"latinName":"Antirrhinum Triphyllum","genus":31,"commonName":"Three-Leaved\nToad-Flax","slug":"antirrhinum-triphyllum","volume":9,"datePublished":1795,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38382/38382-h/38382-h.htm#plate_324","image":{"height":860,"width":506,"type":"jpg","name":"324_antirrhinum_triphyllum.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Didynamia Angiospermia","class":14,"order":142,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-phyllus.

He appears to have been a stranger to the particoloured variety now so generally cultivated as an ornamental annual in our gardens; in its wild state the flowers of this Antirrhinum are of a yellow hue, with little or no purple in them, such indeed are frequently produced from seeds sown in our gardens.\nIt is a hardy annual, a native of Spain and Sicily, a plant of ready growth, requiring the common treatment of annuals sown in the Spring, and much disposed indeed to come up spontaneously where it has once grown; in sowing its seeds, care should be taken to preserve the produce of such flowers as have the most purple in them.","pages":[],"species":[74,99,200,205]}],"genera":[{"id":1,"name":"Iris","flowers":[1,9,16,21,91,50,58,61,168,187]},{"id":2,"name":"Rudbeckia","flowers":[2]},{"id":3,"name":"Helleborus","flowers":[3,8,72]},{"id":4,"name":"Cyclamen","flowers":[4,44]},{"id":5,"name":"Erythronium","flowers":[5]},{"id":6,"name":"Narcissus","flowers":[6,15,78,88,121,48,51,193,197]},{"id":7,"name":"Cynoglossum","flowers":[7]},{"id":8,"name":"Anemone","flowers":[10,123,54]},{"id":9,"name":"Erica","flowers":[11,220,189,440,443,447,303]},{"id":10,"name":"Dodecatheon","flowers":[12]},{"id":11,"name":"Coronilla","flowers":[13,185,258,445]},{"id":12,"name":"Primula","flowers":[14,229,191]},{"id":13,"name":"Cactus","flowers":[17]},{"id":14,"name":"Geranium","flowers":[18,20,95,55,56,203,206]},{"id":15,"name":"Hemerocallis","flowers":[19,64]},{"id":16,"name":"Nigella","flowers":[22]},{"id":17,"name":"Tropæolum","flowers":[23,98]},{"id":18,"name":"Agrostemma","flowers":[24,295]},{"id":19,"name":"Dianthus","flowers":[25,207,297]},{"id":20,"name":"Stapelia","flowers":[26]},{"id":21,"name":"Convolvulus","flowers":[27,113,188,459,289]},{"id":22,"name":"Passiflora","flowers":[28,66,288]},{"id":23,"name":"Reseda","flowers":[29]},{"id":24,"name":"Lilium","flowers":[30,36,259,278]},{"id":25,"name":"Jasminum","flowers":[31,285,461]},{"id":26,"name":"Mesembryanthemum","flowers":[32,59,67,70,262,448]},{"id":27,"name":"Aster","flowers":[33,199]},{"id":28,"name":"Browallia","flowers":[34]},{"id":29,"name":"Crepis","flowers":[35]},{"id":30,"name":"Monsonia","flowers":[73]},{"id":31,"name":"Antirrhinum","flowers":[74,99,200,205,324]},{"id":32,"name":"Potentilla","flowers":[75]},{"id":33,"name":"Epilobium","flowers":[76]},{"id":34,"name":"Centaurea","flowers":[77,62]},{"id":35,"name":"Lotus","flowers":[79,151]},{"id":36,"name":"Spigelia","flowers":[80]},{"id":37,"name":"Colutea","flowers":[81,181]},{"id":38,"name":"Lachenalia","flowers":[82]},{"id":39,"name":"Hibiscus","flowers":[83,158,209,436]},{"id":40,"name":"Tussilago","flowers":[84]},{"id":41,"name":"Spartium","flowers":[85]},{"id":42,"name":"Gladiolus","flowers":[86,135,272,450]},{"id":43,"name":"Hyoscyamus","flowers":[87]},{"id":44,"name":"Viola","flowers":[89]},{"id":45,"name":"Gorteria","flowers":[90]},{"id":46,"name":"Saxifraga","flowers":[92,196]},{"id":47,"name":"Sempervivum","flowers":[93,68,296]},{"id":48,"name":"Sisyrinchium","flowers":[94,464]},{"id":49,"name":"Lantana","flowers":[96]},{"id":50,"name":"Fuchsia","flowers":[97]},{"id":51,"name":"Lathyrus","flowers":[100,111,115,60,253]},{"id":52,"name":"Alyssum","flowers":[101,126,130,159]},{"id":53,"name":"Campanula","flowers":[102,117,252]},{"id":54,"name":"Pelargonium","flowers":[103,136,143,148,165,240,201,309,315]},{"id":55,"name":"Lysimachia","flowers":[104]},{"id":56,"name":"Tradescantia","flowers":[105]},{"id":57,"name":"Iberis","flowers":[106,124]},{"id":58,"name":"Cassia","flowers":[107]},{"id":59,"name":"Anthyllis","flowers":[108]},{"id":60,"name":"Lavatera","flowers":[109]},{"id":61,"name":"Mimosa","flowers":[110,302]},{"id":62,"name":"Cistus","flowers":[112,43,264]},{"id":63,"name":"Silene","flowers":[114]},{"id":64,"name":"Limodorum","flowers":[116]},{"id":65,"name":"Sedum","flowers":[118,211]},{"id":66,"name":"Strelitzia","flowers":[119]},{"id":67,"name":"Hyacinthus","flowers":[122,133,157]},{"id":68,"name":"Alstrœmeria","flowers":[125,139]},{"id":69,"name":"Ixia","flowers":[127,171,184,256,265]},{"id":70,"name":"Scilla","flowers":[128]},{"id":71,"name":"Amaryllis","flowers":[129,47,239,453,290,294,305]},{"id":72,"name":"Catesbæa","flowers":[131]},{"id":73,"name":"Rubus","flowers":[132,323]},{"id":74,"name":"Adonis","flowers":[134]},{"id":75,"name":"Hypericum","flowers":[137,146,178]},{"id":76,"name":"Kalmia","flowers":[138,175,177]},{"id":77,"name":"Lupinus","flowers":[140,202]},{"id":78,"name":"Heliotropium","flowers":[141]},{"id":79,"name":"Scorzonera","flowers":[142]},{"id":80,"name":"Ferraria","flowers":[144]},{"id":81,"name":"Chironia","flowers":[37,233]},{"id":82,"name":"Viburnum","flowers":[38]},{"id":83,"name":"Franklin's","flowers":[39]},{"id":84,"name":"Trillium","flowers":[40]},{"id":85,"name":"Calceolaria","flowers":[41]},{"id":86,"name":"Camellia","flowers":[42]},{"id":87,"name":"Crocus","flowers":[45]},{"id":88,"name":"Leucojum","flowers":[46]},{"id":89,"name":"Soldanella","flowers":[49]},{"id":90,"name":"Gentiana","flowers":[52]},{"id":91,"name":"Cineraria","flowers":[53,249]},{"id":92,"name":"Papaver","flowers":[57]},{"id":93,"name":"Fragaria","flowers":[63]},{"id":94,"name":"Clematis","flowers":[65]},{"id":95,"name":"Rosa","flowers":[69,284]},{"id":96,"name":"Statice","flowers":[71]},{"id":97,"name":"Monarda","flowers":[145]},{"id":98,"name":"Dais","flowers":[147]},{"id":99,"name":"Zinnia","flowers":[149]},{"id":100,"name":"Tagetes","flowers":[150]},{"id":101,"name":"Epidendrum","flowers":[152,463]},{"id":102,"name":"Bulbocodium","flowers":[153]},{"id":103,"name":"Saponaria","flowers":[154]},{"id":104,
