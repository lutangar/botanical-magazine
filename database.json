Mr. Lee, Nurseryman of the\nVineyard, Hammersmith, in looking over some dried specimens in the\nPossession of Sir Joseph Banks, which he had recently received\nfrom the Cape of Good Hope, was struck with the singular appearance of\nthis Geranium, no species having before been seen in this country with\nspear-shaped leaves; on examining the specimens attentively, he\nperceived a few ripe seeds in one of them, those he solicited, and\nobtained; and to his success in making them vegetate, we are indebted\nfor the present species.The shape of the leaf readily suggested the name of lanceolatum, an\nepithet by which it has been generally distinguished in this country,\nand which, from its extreme fitness, we have continued, notwithstanding\nyoung Professor Linnæus has given it that of glaucum, though,\nat the same time, his illustrious father had distinguished another\nspecies by the synonymous term of glaucophyllum.This species rarely ripens its seeds with us, and is therefore to be\nraised from cuttings, which however are not very free to strike.It has been usual to keep it in the stove, but we have found by\nexperience, that it succeeds much better in a common green-house, in\nwhich it will flower during the whole of the summer. Small young plants\nof this, as well as most other Geraniums, make the best appearance, and\nare therefore to be frequently obtained by cuttings.","pages":[126,127,128]},{"id":57,"latinName":"Papaver Orientale","commonName":" Eastern Poppy","slug":"papaver-orientale","volume":1,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17531/17531-h/17531-h.htm#Papaver","image":"papaver_orientale.jpg","classAndOrder":"Polyandria Monogynia","genericCharacters":["Cor","4-petala","Cal","2-phyllus","Capsula, 1-locularis sub stigmate\npersistente poris dehiscens.Specific Character and Synonyms."],"synonyms":["PAPAVER orientale capsulis glabris, caulibus unifloris scabris\nfoliosis pinnatis serratis.

Shrub from two to three feet or more in height, the thickest part of the stem not exceeding the size of the little\nfinger, covered with a smooth brown bark, irregularly branched;\nFlowers appearing before the leaves are fully expanded, and\nproduced in umbels at the extremities of the branches, from\neight to twelve or more in an umbel, of a fine yellow colour\nand agreeable fragrance; each blossom is about the size of that\nof the horse-chestnut, and as some of them are produced much\nearlier than others, the plant of course continues a considerable\ntime in bloom, standing on short peduncles; Calyx very\nshort, viscous, and irregularly divided, most commonly into\nfive ovato-lanceolate segments; Corolla, tube cylindrical, viscous,\ngrooved, brim divided into five segments, undulated and\nsomewhat wrinkled, ovate, pointed, three turning upwards,\ntwo downwards, of the three uppermost segments the middle\none more intensely yellow than the others and inclining to\norange, with which it is sometimes spotted; Stamina usually\nfive, yellow, projecting beyond the corolla, and turning upwards\nnear their extremities; Antheræ orange-coloured; Pollen\nwhitish and thready; Germen somewhat conical, evidently\nhairy, and somewhat angular; Style yellowish, filiform, projecting\nbeyond the stamina, and turning upwards; Stigma\nforming a round green head.The figure and description here given were taken from a plant which\nflowered by means of artificial heat, in the spring of 1798, at Mr.\nWatson's, Nurseryman, Islington, and which had been introduced\nthe same year, by Mr. Anthony Hove, of Warsaw.As an hardy ornamental shrub, it bids fair to prove an acquisition truly\nvaluable, its flowers produced in the months of June and July, being\nhighly ornamental as well as fragrant.We have the best authority for regarding this plant as the Chamærhodendros\nPontica of Tournefort, it agrees with his own specimens\nin Sir Joseph Banks's Herbarium, it accords also with his description,\nand figures, more especially of those flowers which are of their\nnatural size; nor have we any doubts of its being the Azalea Pontica of\nProf. Pallas, figured in the Flor. Rossica, since it corresponds generally\nwith his description, though not in all points with his figure, which\nbears evident marks of inaccuracy, the stigma, for instance, is represented\nas trifid.Tournefort found this plant on the eastern side of the Black Sea,\nMr. Hove on the north side near Oczakow, and elsewhere; Professor\nPallas on Mount Caucasus.As yet there has been no opportunity of ascertaining the best means of\npropagating this new denizen, but there is every reason to suppose that\nit will succeed with the treatment bestowed on the other Azalea's.Prof. Pallas relates that the honey of bees frequenting the flowers\nof this plant is supposed to be narcotic, and that goats, kine, and\nsheep on eating its leaves have been poisoned thereby.By permission and with the approbation of Mr. Anthony Hove,\nthe following extracts from his journal are here inserted.\"June 9, 1796, found a few of this species of Azalea on the river\nDnieper in swampy ground, four feet high, beginning to blow,\ncalled here the stupifying shrub, and considered by some as highly\nefficacious in curing the venereal disease.\"June 20, found this species on the river Dniester, on the estate of\nCount Stanislaus Sczesny Potocki, about sixteen English\nmiles from the town of Mohilow, in peat earth, from four to twenty\nfeet high; regarded by the common people as intoxicating, and\nused in the cure of various diseases.\"July 4, near Oczakow, found thousands of these plants fully\nblown, in a marsh, every spring-tide overflown by the sea; found\nthere also, a Tartarian farmer, who lived entirely by the profits\narising from the honey which the bees extracted from the flowers\nof this plant, sold to Constantinople and other parts of Turkey for\nmedicinal uses.\"July 15, arrived at Trebizond, found a valley about ten English\nmiles from the sea covered with these plants.\"On cultivation, Mr. Hove relates that he found the Azalea's from\nTrebizond much more tender than those from the borders of the\nDnieper and the Dniester, and was therefore inclined to regard them\nas strong varieties if not distinct species.The leaves, when fully expanded, are in size and figure like those\non the plate, hairy on both sides, and terminating in a very remarkable\nblunt mucro or point, which has not been noticed either by those who\nhave described or figured the plant as it deserves, for it appears to\nform a very strong character.","pages":[]},{"id":434,"latinName":"Triandria Monogynia","commonName":"","slug":"triandria-monogynia","volume":1,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43858/43858-h/43858-h.htm#plate_434","image":"triandria_monogynia.jpg","classAndOrder":"","genericCharacters":[],"synonyms":[],"description":"Class and Order.Generic Character.Specific Character and Synonyms.The present is one of those plants which is entitled to our admiration, for its curious and singular structure, rather than\nfor any extraordinary figure it makes in a collection; not that\nits flowers are without a certain share of beauty.It is an annual, growing to about the height of two feet;\nthe whole plant is viscous, and, if bruised, smells somewhat disagreeably;\nthe flowers do not open at any particular time as\nthose of the Mirabilis do, and each contains only three stamina;\nwhen they fall off, which they do soon after expanding, the\ncalyx closes on the germen, enlarges, droops, and becomes\ndeeply plaited; on the ripening of the seed it turns brown,\nexpands, and is suspended like a little umbrella over the seed,\nwhich when perfectly ripe drops out on the ground; the expanded\ncalyx in this state appears somewhat like the flower of\na Physalis.This plant flowers from June to October, and ripens its\nseeds in the open air; it is not difficult of culture, requires the\nsame treatment as other tender annuals from Peru.Our figure was drawn from a plant which flowered 1796,\nin the collection of the Marchioness of Bute, and was raised\nfrom Peruvian seeds, sent her by Prof. Ortega of Madrid,\nunder the name of Mirabilis triandra; Mons.

In 1788, Mr. Walter\npublished his Fl. Carolin. in which he describes a second species\nof Hydrangea, which he calls radiata,[2] having very distinctly,\nas in the Viburnum, two different kinds of florets in\nthe same Cyma, this variation in the florets is added by him to\nthe generic character: the similarity which exists between the\nflowers of Mr. Walter's Hydrangea radiata, and those of the\npresent plant sufficiently justify Dr. Smith in making it an\nHydrangea; the appearances observed by Loureiro[3] on dissecting\nthe germen, and our discovery of the existence of two\ndifferent kinds of flowers in the Hydrangea arborescens, tend\nstill more to confirm its propriety; we may add, that in the very\nhabit of these several plants there exists a considerable similarity;\nstill, however, it is only by ripe seed-vessels of the present plant,\nthat this doubtful matter can be satisfactorily cleared up; but it\nwill not follow, that if it be not an Hydrangea it must be a\nViburnum.This magnificent and highly ornamental plant, according\nto Dr. Smith, was introduced from China to the royal\ngarden at Kew, by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. in 1790; it\nwas imported by Mr. Slater about the same time, with whom\nit is said to have first flowered in this country.If room were allowed us, it would be superfluous to describe\nminutely a plant now so very common; suffice it to\nsay, that from a strong perennial root, rise a number of half-shrubby,\nirregular, somewhat spongy stalks, strongly spotted\nwhen young with purple, from one to three feet high, terminated\nby large bunches of flowers, at first green, then rose-coloured,\nand finally green a second time; these are the most\ncommon changes to which they are liable: but it will sometimes\nhappen that a plant which has produced red flowers\none year, shall produce blue another, though growing in the\nsame pot; this we saw happen in the year 1796 to a plant in\nthe possession of the Countess of Upper Ossory, whose refined\ntaste and superior judgment have in several instances\ncontributed to render our works more acceptable to the\npublic: the coloured changeable part of the flower is regarded\nas the calyx, in the centre of which is the corolla,\ncontaining the stamina, &c. all varying greatly in point of\nnumber; besides these, there are other flowers without any\ncalyx, but the parts which they contain do not seem to be\nmore perfect than those of the others, nor more productive\nof ripe fruit.Since the introduction of this plant, trials have been made\nin regard to its hardiness, and it is found to survive mild winters\nif planted in very warm sheltered situations; but in others,\nboth stalks and leaves are liable to be killed by slight frosts,\nthough the roots are not; if persons are anxious to have it\nin the open border, the best mode will be to cut down the\nstems at the approach of winter, and cover over the root\nwith rotten tan, or some light substance; in the spring fresh\nstalks will shoot forth, but it is more common to keep this\nplant during winter in a green-house or well secured frame;\nby artificial heat it may be brought to flower in April or\nMay, without such, it begins to blossom about June, and continues\nin bloom till October; when successfully treated, it\nwill acquire the height of three feet, and produce bunches\nof flowers supremely magnificent: such plants in pots are admirably\nadapted for decorating court-yards, balconies, &c.\nunless carefully cut in, it is apt to grow too large for the\ngreen-house, therefore it is proper to have a succession of\nyoung plants from cuttings, which strike very freely; this\nplant loves water, is indeed almost an aquatic, a rich soil, and\nplenty of pot room.","pages":[]},{"id":439,"latinName":"Polyandria Polygynia","commonName":"","slug":"polyandria-polygynia","volume":1,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43858/43858-h/43858-h.htm#plate_439","image":"polyandria_polygynia.jpg","classAndOrder":"","genericCharacters":[],"synonyms":[],"description":"Class and Order.Generic Character.Specific Character and Synonyms.Of the genus Illicium there are at present only two known species, viz. the anisatum and floridanum, the former a native\nof China and Japan, the latter of Florida;

E. Smith, who received them from Madrid, to which\nplace they were sent from South-America, and where the plant as Mons.\nCavanille informs us, grows spontaneously near Mexico. In October 1793,\nwe had the pleasure of seeing the plant again in blossom in the\naforesaid garden, raised from seeds which ripened there the preceding\nyear, but unfortunately from the lateness of their flowering, and the\nvery great injury the plants had sustained from the Cobweb Mite (Acarus\nteliarius) vulgarly called the red Spider, there seemed little prospect\nthat the seed-vessels would arrive at perfection.The seeds were sown by Mr. Fairbairn, in March, and the plants kept in\nthe green-house till very late in the summer, when to accelerate their\nblowing, they were removed into the dry stove: it is worthy of remark,\nthat these plants, even late in the autumn, shew no signs of blossoming,\nbut the flowers at length come forth with almost unexampled rapidity,\nand the seed-vessels are formed as quickly, so that if the flowers were\nnot very numerous, their blossoming period would be of very short\nduration; future experience may perhaps point out the means of making\nthe plant blow earlier: in Spain, the blossoms appeared later than here,\nMons.

With double flowers.\n2. With flowers blotched with purple.\n3.

Bauhine, the Sultan\nZambach of Clusius, and the Hortus Eystettensis, as one of its\nvarieties also: Miller regards this plant as a distinct species, and\nthose who have attentively examined the figures and descriptions of\nClusius and the Hort.

Mr. W.\nHale, of Alton, Hants, who resided at Halifax in Nova-Scotia several\nyears, brought me some seeds of it gathered in that neighbourhood, which\nvegetated, and produced flowering plants: it is not new to this country,\nbeing known to Morison who figures it, and to Miller, who cultivated it\nin 1731.It is a hardy perennial plant, growing to about the height of a foot and\na half, or two feet, and flowering from the beginning of July, to\nSeptember; it has a creeping root, thereby it increases greatly in light\ndry soils, and warm situations, so as even to be troublesome; it will\nnot thrive in a wet soil; with us it produces seed-vessels but rarely;\nis propagated by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring; Miller\nrecommends March as the most proper season, or it may be raised from\nseeds, which in certain situations and seasons ripen here.The flowers of this Apocynum have a sweet honey-like fragrance, which\nperfumes the air to a considerable distance, and no doubt operates\npowerfully in attracting insects; when a plant of this sort is fully\nblown, one may always find flies caught in its blossoms, usually by the\ntrunk, very rarely by the leg; sometimes four, or even five, which is\nthe greatest possible number, are found in one flower, some dead, others\nendeavouring to disentangle themselves, in which they are now and then\nso fortunate as to succeed; these flies are of different species, the\nmusca pipiens, a slender variegated fly with thick thighs, is a very\ncommon victim, the musca domestica, or house fly, we have never\nobserved among the captives.Previous to our explaining the manner in which it appears to us that\nthese insects are caught, it will be necessary that we should describe,\nin as plain a manner as possible, those parts of the flower which more\nparticularly constitute this fatal fly trap.On looking into the flower we perceive five Stamina, the Antheræ of\nwhich are large, of a yellow colour, and converge into a kind of cone;\neach of these Antheræ is arrow-shaped, towards the top of the cone their\nsides touch but do not adhere, below they separate a little, so as to\nleave a very narrow opening or slit between each, they are placed on\nvery short filaments, which stand so far apart that a considerable\nopening is left between them, which openings, however, are closed up by\nprocesses of the corolla, nicely adapted to, and projecting into them;\nat the bottom of, and in the very centre of the flower, we perceive two\ngermina, or seed-buds, the rudiments of future seed-vessels, surrounded\nby glandular substances, secreting a sweet liquid; on the summit of\nthese germina, and betwixt the two, stands the stigma, in the form of a\nlittle urn, the middle of which is encircled by a glandular ring, which\nsecretes a viscid honey-like substance, to this part of the stigma the\nAntheræ interiorly adhere most tenaciously, so as to prevent their\nseparation unless considerable force be applied; it is, as we apprehend,\nthe sweet viscid substance thus secreted by the stigma, within the\nAntheræ, which the fly endeavours to obtain, and to this end insinuates\nits trunk first into the lowermost and widest part of the slit, betwixt\neach of the Antheræ above described, pushing it of necessity upwards:\nwhen gratified, not having the sense to place itself in the same\nposition as that in which it stood when it inserted its trunk, and to\ndraw it out in the same direction downwards, unfortunately for it, it\nvaries its position, and pulling its trunk upwards, draws it into the\nnarrow part of the slit, where it becomes closely wedged in, and the\nmore it pulls the more securely it is caught, and thus this heedless\ninsect, as Thomson calls it, terminates its existence in captivity most\nmiserable.In the incomparable poem of Dr. Darwin, entitled the Botanic Garden,\nthere is a figure given of this plant; and in the Supplement we have the\nfollowing account written by Mr. Darwin, of Elston.\"In the Apocynum Androsæmifolium the Anthers converge over the\nnectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles, surrounding\nthe germ, and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the\ninterstice between each anther; but when a fly inserts its proboscis\nbetween these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and\nwith such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes.\"This explanation of a phænomenon entitled to much attention, is widely\ndifferent from ours; which of the two is most consonant to truth and\nnature, we shall leave to the determination of future observers.In explaining the preceding appearances, to prevent confusion we called\nthose parts which form the cone in the middle of the flower Antheræ, but\nstrictly speaking they are not such, the true Antheræ being situated on\nthe inside of their summits, where they will be found to be ten in\nnumber, making in fact the Apocynum a decandrous plant.","pages":[]},{"latinName":"Class and Order","commonName":"","slug":"class-and-order","volume":1,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#Turnera_Angustifolia_Narrow-Leavd_Turnera","image":"class_and_order.jpg","classAndOrder":"Generic Character","genericCharacters":[],"synonyms":[],"description":"This plant here represented is generally known to the Nurserymen about London as the Turnera ulmifolia, or Elm-leav'd Turnera, its foliage\nhowever does not answer to the name, nor to the figures of the plant as\ngiven by Martyn in his Cent.

Veget. ed. 14.\nMurr. his specific description there given, agrees much better with the\nplants we have seen flower here, than that of Linnæus does, there being\ngenerally more than one flower on a stalk, and the leaves rarely growing\nthree together.The blossoms of this plant when it grows in perfection, are very large,\nnearly twice the size of those of the Campanula carpatica, whence its\nname of grandiflora; previous to their opening fully, they somewhat\nresemble an air balloon, from which circumstance it has been called by\nsome the Balloon plant.It is a hardy perennial, a native of Siberia and Tartary, and was\nintroduced to this country by Mr. John Bell in the year 1782.It flowers in July, is as yet a rare plant in this country, and likely\nto continue so, as it is not easily increased, multiplying but little by\nits roots, scarcely to be struck from cuttings, and rarely producing\nperfect seeds.","pages":[]}]}
