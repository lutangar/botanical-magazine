The Chinese call it Santanhoa; with them it produces flowers and fruit the year through, and they hold the blossoms in such veneration, as to use them in the sacrifices they make to their idol Ixora, whence Linnæus has taken the name applied by him to this genus. The root is said to possess some acrimony, and to be made use of by the natives in curing the toothach.\nIt is customary in this country, to treat the Ixora as a stove plant; perhaps it may be less tender than we are aware of; it flowers in July and August, but has not been known to produce fruit; is increased from cuttings, without much difficulty.\nOur drawing was taken from a small but very healthy plant in the stove of Mr. Whitley (late Thoburn and Whitley, Brompton).\nLinnæus describes, and some authors figure this plant with stipulæ, which our plant had not, not being arrived at an age, perhaps, to produce them.","pages":[]},{"id":170,"latinName":"Draba Aizoides","commonName":"Sengreen Draba or","slug":"draba-aizoides","volume":5,"datePublished":1791,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/19123/19123-h/19123-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":571,"type":"jpg","name":"170_draba_aizoides.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Whitlow-Grass","class":22,"order":243,"genericCharacters":["Generic Character.Silicula integra, ovali-oblonga: valvis planiusculis, dissepimento\nparallelis.

Amer.) describes it as spreading much from its running roots; we have not observed it to do so in any great degree here; it is propagated by layers, by cuttings of the roots, and by grafting; it is of ready growth, disposed to blow even when young, and not nice as to soil, or situation; the flowers afford a good example of the class Diadelphia, they are large and beautiful, but without scent.\nWas cultivated by Mr. Miller in 1758.

The flowers which make their appearance from May to November are usually succeeded by seeds, by which the plant is propagated.\nIt is a native of the Cape, and, according to Mr. Aiton, was introduced by Mr. Masson, in 1774.\nThe blossoms have a singular but unpleasant smell, not perceivable at a distance.\nThe variety of pleasant colours so conspicuous in the flowers, renders this rare plant desirable to such as aim at a general collection.","pages":[]},{"id":323,"latinName":"Rubus Odoratus","commonName":"Flowering Raspberry","slug":"rubus-odoratus","volume":9,"datePublished":1795,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38382/38382-h/38382-h.htm#plate_323","image":{"height":860,"width":506,"type":"jpg","name":"323_rubus_odoratus.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Icosandria Polygynia","class":12,"order":13,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus.

Rossica, since it corresponds generally with his description, though not in all points with his figure, which bears evident marks of inaccuracy, the stigma, for instance, is represented as trifid.\nTournefort found this plant on the eastern side of the Black Sea, Mr. Hove on the north side near Oczakow, and elsewhere; Professor Pallas on Mount Caucasus.\nAs yet there has been no opportunity of ascertaining the best means of propagating this new denizen, but there is every reason to suppose that it will succeed with the treatment bestowed on the other Azalea's.\nProf. Pallas relates that the honey of bees frequenting the flowers of this plant is supposed to be narcotic, and that goats, kine, and sheep on eating its leaves have been poisoned thereby.\nBy permission and with the approbation of Mr. Anthony Hove, the following extracts from his journal are here inserted.\"June 9, 1796, found a few of this species of Azalea on the river Dnieper in swampy ground, four feet high, beginning to blow, called here the stupifying shrub, and considered by some as highly efficacious in curing the venereal disease.\"June 20, found this species on the river Dniester, on the estate of Count Stanislaus Sczesny Potocki, about sixteen English miles from the town of Mohilow, in peat earth, from four to twenty feet high; regarded by the common people as intoxicating, and used in the cure of various diseases.\"July 4, near Oczakow, found thousands of these plants fully blown, in a marsh, every spring-tide overflown by the sea; found there also, a Tartarian farmer, who lived entirely by the profits arising from the honey which the bees extracted from the flowers of this plant, sold to Constantinople and other parts of Turkey for medicinal uses.\"July 15, arrived at Trebizond, found a valley about ten English miles from the sea covered with these plants.\"On cultivation, Mr. Hove relates that he found the Azalea's from Trebizond much more tender than those from the borders of the Dnieper and the Dniester, and was therefore inclined to regard them as strong varieties if not distinct species.\nThe leaves, when fully expanded, are in size and figure like those on the plate, hairy on both sides, and terminating in a very remarkable blunt mucro or point, which has not been noticed either by those who have described or figured the plant as it deserves, for it appears to form a very strong character.","pages":[]},{"id":434,"latinName":"Oxybaphus Viscosus","commonName":"Viscid Umbrella-Wort","slug":"oxybaphus-viscosus","volume":13,"datePublished":1799,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43858/43858-h/43858-h.htm#plate_434","image":{"height":1000,"width":611,"type":"jpg","name":"434_oxybaphus_viscosus.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Triandria Monogynia","class":3,"order":1,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus campanulatus.

In 1788, Mr. Walter published his Fl. Carolin. in which he describes a second species of Hydrangea, which he calls radiata,[2] having very distinctly, as in the Viburnum, two different kinds of florets in the same Cyma, this variation in the florets is added by him to the generic character: the similarity which exists between the flowers of Mr. Walter's Hydrangea radiata, and those of the present plant sufficiently justify Dr. Smith in making it an Hydrangea; the appearances observed by Loureiro[3] on dissecting the germen, and our discovery of the existence of two different kinds of flowers in the Hydrangea arborescens, tend still more to confirm its propriety; we may add, that in the very habit of these several plants there exists a considerable similarity; still, however, it is only by ripe seed-vessels of the present plant, that this doubtful matter can be satisfactorily cleared up; but it will not follow, that if it be not an Hydrangea it must be a Viburnum.\nThis magnificent and highly ornamental plant, according to Dr. Smith, was introduced from China to the royal garden at Kew, by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. in 1790; it was imported by Mr. Slater about the same time, with whom it is said to have first flowered in this country.\nIf room were allowed us, it would be superfluous to describe minutely a plant now so very common; suffice it to say, that from a strong perennial root, rise a number of half-shrubby, irregular, somewhat spongy stalks, strongly spotted when young with purple, from one to three feet high, terminated by large bunches of flowers, at first green, then rose-coloured, and finally green a second time; these are the most common changes to which they are liable: but it will sometimes happen that a plant which has produced red flowers one year, shall produce blue another, though growing in the same pot; this we saw happen in the year 1796 to a plant in the possession of the Countess of Upper Ossory, whose refined taste and superior judgment have in several instances contributed to render our works more acceptable to the public: the coloured changeable part of the flower is regarded as the calyx, in the centre of which is the corolla, containing the stamina, &c. all varying greatly in point of number; besides these, there are other flowers without any calyx, but the parts which they contain do not seem to be more perfect than those of the others, nor more productive of ripe fruit.\nSince the introduction of this plant, trials have been made in regard to its hardiness, and it is found to survive mild winters if planted in very warm sheltered situations; but in others, both stalks and leaves are liable to be killed by slight frosts, though the roots are not; if persons are anxious to have it in the open border, the best mode will be to cut down the stems at the approach of winter, and cover over the root with rotten tan, or some light substance; in the spring fresh stalks will shoot forth, but it is more common to keep this plant during winter in a green-house or well secured frame; by artificial heat it may be brought to flower in April or May, without such, it begins to blossom about June, and continues in bloom till October; when successfully treated, it will acquire the height of three feet, and produce bunches of flowers supremely magnificent: such plants in pots are admirably adapted for decorating court-yards, balconies, &c. unless carefully cut in, it is apt to grow too large for the green-house, therefore it is proper to have a succession of young plants from cuttings, which strike very freely; this plant loves water, is indeed almost an aquatic, a rich soil, and plenty of pot room.","pages":[]},{"id":439,"latinName":"Illicium Floridanum","commonName":"","slug":"illicium-floridanum","volume":13,"datePublished":1799,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/43858/43858-h/43858-h.htm#plate_439","image":{"height":1000,"width":833,"type":"jpg","name":"439_illicium_floridanum.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Polyandria Polygynia","class":13,"order":13,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 6-phyllus.

In this remarkable change of colour, it bears some affinity to the Œnothera anomala, which may be considered as strengthening our opinion that the latter plant belongs to this genus rather than to that of Gaura. The Œnothera tetraptera is a native of Mexico, its duration as yet not certainly ascertained, but may be treated as a tender annual; and such plants as do not flower the first year, may be preserved under glasses through the winter.

To succeed in its cultivation, it should be placed in a pot of stiffish loam, mixed with one-third rotten leaves, bog earth, or dung, and plunged in a north border, taking care that it does not suffer for want of water in dry seasons; thus treated, it increases by its roots nearly as readily as the Auricula, and may be propagated by parting its' roots early in April or September. |","pages":[]},{"id":192,"latinName":"Cypripedium Acaule","commonName":"Two-Leaved Lady's Slipper","slug":"cypripedium-acaule","volume":6,"datePublished":1793,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21843/21843-h/21843-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":985,"width":1000,"type":"jpg","name":"192_cypripedium_acaule.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Gynandria Diandria","class":20,"order":2,"genericCharacters":["Nectarium ventricosum, inflatum, cavum."],"synonyms":["CYPRIPEDIUM acaule radicibus fibrosis, foliis oblongis\nradicalibus.

Since then the term poeticus is equally suitable to both, and as there cannot be two with the same name, we have thought it best to get rid of it altogether, and substitute others which tend in a certain degree to discriminate the several species, denominating the 1st. angustifolius. 2d. majalis. 3d. biflorus. The angustifolius here figured is a native of the South of Europe, and said by Magnol and Clusius to grow spontaneously in the meadows about Narbonne and Montpelier.\nIt flowers in our gardens early in April, about a month before the biflorus, and full six weeks sooner than the majalis, increases readily by offsets, and succeeds best in a soil that is moderately moist.

Pl.) in which are contained small black seeds, whose surface is beautifully reticulated with impressed dots; the sides of the seed-vessel are fleshy, and do not appear to divide or split in any regular manner for the discharge of the seed; they must however be regarded rather as capsules than berries: in the genus Hypericum, the seed-vessels are found to vary in a somewhat similar manner; in this part of the fructification there is not, therefore, that deviation which has been supposed, but there is a very great one in the antheræ, which do not ultimately become spiral.\nThis plant, which grows to the height of a foot and a half or two feet, becomes very bushy, rather too much so in point of ornament, and produces both flowers, and fruit, during most of the summer.\nThough regarded as a greenhouse plant, it does not ripen its seeds well unless kept in the stove; is with difficulty raised from cuttings, from seeds readily, by which it requires to be frequently renovated.\nWas cultivated by Mr. Miller in 1759.

E. Smith, who received them from Madrid, to which place they were sent from South-America, and where the plant as Mons. Cavanille informs us, grows spontaneously near Mexico. In October 1793, we had the pleasure of seeing the plant again in blossom in the aforesaid garden, raised from seeds which ripened there the preceding year, but unfortunately from the lateness of their flowering, and the very great injury the plants had sustained from the Cobweb Mite (Acarus teliarius) vulgarly called the red Spider, there seemed little prospect that the seed-vessels would arrive at perfection.\nThe seeds were sown by Mr. Fairbairn, in March, and the plants kept in the green-house till very late in the summer, when to accelerate their blowing, they were removed into the dry stove: it is worthy of remark, that these plants, even late in the autumn, shew no signs of blossoming, but the flowers at length come forth with almost unexampled rapidity, and the seed-vessels are formed as quickly, so that if the flowers were not very numerous, their blossoming period would be of very short duration; future experience may perhaps point out the means of making the plant blow earlier: in Spain, the blossoms appeared later than here, Mons. Cavanille observed them in the Royal Garden, in November and December, most probably in the open ground, as no mention is made of the plants having been preserved from the weather.\nIt was not till long after our description was taken, that we had an opportunity of seeing Mons.

With double flowers. 2. With flowers blotched with purple. 3. With striped leaves, or leaves edged with yellow. The two first of these are to be esteemed merely as curiosities; in the third the plant acquires an accession of beauty which it has not originally; though many persons object to variegated leaves, as conveying an idea of fickliness, that complaint cannot be urged against the foliage of the striped Lily, to which the borders of the flower-garden are indebted for one of their chief ornaments during the autumnal and winter months; early in September these begin to emerge, and towards spring another set rises up in their centre, of more upright growth, and which announce the rising of the flowering stem.\nBesides these varieties, Linnæus has considered the Lilium album floribus dependentibus s. peregrinum of C. Bauhine, the Sultan Zambach of Clusius, and the Hortus Eystettensis, as one of its varieties also: Miller regards this plant as a distinct species, and those who have attentively examined the figures and descriptions of Clusius and the Hort. Eyst. will be of the same opinion.\nThe Lily increases most abundantly by offsets, hence it becomes necessary that the bulbs should be taken up, and reduced every second or third year; but the striped leaved variety increasing much more slowly, should remain unmolested for a greater length of time.\nThere is scarcely a soil or situation in which the Lily will not grow, it will thrive most in a soil moderately stiff and moist; though a native of a warm climate no severity of weather affects it with us: we may learn from this, not to regulate the culture of plants invariably by the climate in which they grow spontaneously.\nThe best time for removing the bulbs of this plant is about the middle of August, before they shoot forth their leaves; but they may be transplanted any time from September to spring.","pages":[]},{"id":279,"latinName":"Plumeria Rubra","commonName":"Red Plumeria","slug":"plumeria-rubra","volume":8,"datePublished":1794,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":651,"type":"jpg","name":"279_plumeria_rubra.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Pentandria Monogynia","class":5,"order":1,"genericCharacters":["Contorta.

Hale, of Alton, Hants, who resided at Halifax in Nova-Scotia several years, brought me some seeds of it gathered in that neighbourhood, which vegetated, and produced flowering plants: it is not new to this country, being known to Morison who figures it, and to Miller, who cultivated it in 1731.\nIt is a hardy perennial plant, growing to about the height of a foot and a half, or two feet, and flowering from the beginning of July, to September; it has a creeping root, thereby it increases greatly in light dry soils, and warm situations, so as even to be troublesome; it will not thrive in a wet soil; with us it produces seed-vessels but rarely; is propagated by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring; Miller recommends March as the most proper season, or it may be raised from seeds, which in certain situations and seasons ripen here.\nThe flowers of this Apocynum have a sweet honey-like fragrance, which perfumes the air to a considerable distance, and no doubt operates powerfully in attracting insects; when a plant of this sort is fully blown, one may always find flies caught in its blossoms, usually by the trunk, very rarely by the leg; sometimes four, or even five, which is the greatest possible number, are found in one flower, some dead, others endeavouring to disentangle themselves, in which they are now and then so fortunate as to succeed; these flies are of different species, the musca pipiens, a slender variegated fly with thick thighs, is a very common victim, the musca domestica, or house fly, we have never observed among the captives.\nPrevious to our explaining the manner in which it appears to us that these insects are caught, it will be necessary that we should describe, in as plain a manner as possible, those parts of the flower which more particularly constitute this fatal fly trap.\nOn looking into the flower we perceive five Stamina, the Antheræ of which are large, of a yellow colour, and converge into a kind of cone; each of these Antheræ is arrow-shaped, towards the top of the cone their sides touch but do not adhere, below they separate a little, so as to leave a very narrow opening or slit between each, they are placed on very short filaments, which stand so far apart that a considerable opening is left between them, which openings, however, are closed up by processes of the corolla, nicely adapted to, and projecting into them; at the bottom of, and in the very centre of the flower, we perceive two germina, or seed-buds, the rudiments of future seed-vessels, surrounded by glandular substances, secreting a sweet liquid; on the summit of these germina, and betwixt the two, stands the stigma, in the form of a little urn, the middle of which is encircled by a glandular ring, which secretes a viscid honey-like substance, to this part of the stigma the Antheræ interiorly adhere most tenaciously, so as to prevent their separation unless considerable force be applied; it is, as we apprehend, the sweet viscid substance thus secreted by the stigma, within the Antheræ, which the fly endeavours to obtain, and to this end insinuates its trunk first into the lowermost and widest part of the slit, betwixt each of the Antheræ above described, pushing it of necessity upwards: when gratified, not having the sense to place itself in the same position as that in which it stood when it inserted its trunk, and to draw it out in the same direction downwards, unfortunately for it, it varies its position, and pulling its trunk upwards, draws it into the narrow part of the slit, where it becomes closely wedged in, and the more it pulls the more securely it is caught, and thus this heedless insect, as Thomson calls it, terminates its existence in captivity most miserable.\nIn the incomparable poem of Dr. Darwin, entitled the Botanic Garden, there is a figure given of this plant; and in the Supplement we have the following account written by Mr. Darwin, of Elston.\"In the Apocynum Androsæmifolium the Anthers converge over the nectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles, surrounding the germ, and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the interstice between each anther; but when a fly inserts its proboscis between these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and with such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes.\"This explanation of a phænomenon entitled to much attention, is widely different from ours; which of the two is most consonant to truth and nature, we shall leave to the determination of future observers.\nIn explaining the preceding appearances, to prevent confusion we called those parts which form the cone in the middle of the flower Antheræ, but strictly speaking they are not such, the true Antheræ being situated on the inside of their summits, where they will be found to be ten in number, making in fact the Apocynum a decandrous plant.","pages":[]},{"id":281,"latinName":"Turnera Angustifolia","commonName":"Narrow-Leav'd Turnera","slug":"turnera-angustifolia","volume":8,"datePublished":1794,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#undefined","image":{"height":1000,"width":739,"type":"jpg","name":"281_turnera_angustifolia.jpg"},"classAndOrder":"Pentandria Trigynia","class":5,"order":3,"genericCharacters":["Cal. 5-fidus, infundibuliformis, exterior 2-phyllus.

I suggested to Mr. Tolfrey, that those earths might possibly contain the seeds of some curious and unknown plants; he readily acquiesced in the idea, and permitted me to make trial of them: accordingly, in the Spring of 1793, I exposed them in shallow pans, on a gentle tan heat, keeping them duly watered; in the course of the Summer they yielded me fourteen plants, most of which were altogether new, and among others the species of Goodenia here figured; this we have since found to be a hardy greenhouse plant, flowering from July to October, and very readily increased by cuttings.\nThe oldest plant in our possession is about a foot and a half high, much branched, the stalks are round and smooth to the naked eye, green below, above purplish, the leaves are smooth, a deep bright green colour, alternate, standing on footstalks, which gradually widen into the leaves, somewhat ovate, and deeply toothed; the flowers grow in the alæ     of the leaves, forming a thin spike, they are sessile, of a pale violet colour, and have a peculiar smell which is rather unpleasant; at the side of each flower are two long narrow Bracteæ; the Calyx, which is placed on the germen, is composed of five short ovate leaves, which appear edged with hairs if magnified; the Corolla is monopetalous, the lower part, which at first is tubular, splits longitudinally above, and forms a kind of half tube, the edges of which are brown, the inside yellow, the outside greenish, the mouth beset with short hairs, each of which is terminated by a small villous head; the limb is deeply divided into five linear segments, spreading out like a hand, and terminated by short points; the Filaments are five in number, of a whitish colour, somewhat broadest above, rather flat, inserted into the receptacle; Antheræ oval, flattened, yellow, bilocular, a little bent, the length of the pistillum; but this is to be understood of such flowers as are not yet fully expanded, in those that are, they are much shorter, and appear withered; the Style, in flowers about to open, the length of the filaments, upright, in those that are opened much longer, and bent somewhat downward; Stigma at first upright, in the form of a cup, having the edge curiously fringed with white hairs, afterwards it closes together, loses its hollow, and assumes a flat appearance, and nods somewhat, the back part of it is bearded; Germen beneath the calyx, oblong, usually abortive with us.\nThe name of Goodenia has been given to this genus by Dr. Smith, in honour of the Rev.
