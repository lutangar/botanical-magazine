With double flowers.\n2. With flowers blotched with purple.\n3.

Mr. W.\nHale, of Alton, Hants, who resided at Halifax in Nova-Scotia several\nyears, brought me some seeds of it gathered in that neighbourhood, which\nvegetated, and produced flowering plants: it is not new to this country,\nbeing known to Morison who figures it, and to Miller, who cultivated it\nin 1731.It is a hardy perennial plant, growing to about the height of a foot and\na half, or two feet, and flowering from the beginning of July, to\nSeptember; it has a creeping root, thereby it increases greatly in light\ndry soils, and warm situations, so as even to be troublesome; it will\nnot thrive in a wet soil; with us it produces seed-vessels but rarely;\nis propagated by parting its roots in Autumn or Spring; Miller\nrecommends March as the most proper season, or it may be raised from\nseeds, which in certain situations and seasons ripen here.The flowers of this Apocynum have a sweet honey-like fragrance, which\nperfumes the air to a considerable distance, and no doubt operates\npowerfully in attracting insects; when a plant of this sort is fully\nblown, one may always find flies caught in its blossoms, usually by the\ntrunk, very rarely by the leg; sometimes four, or even five, which is\nthe greatest possible number, are found in one flower, some dead, others\nendeavouring to disentangle themselves, in which they are now and then\nso fortunate as to succeed; these flies are of different species, the\nmusca pipiens, a slender variegated fly with thick thighs, is a very\ncommon victim, the musca domestica, or house fly, we have never\nobserved among the captives.Previous to our explaining the manner in which it appears to us that\nthese insects are caught, it will be necessary that we should describe,\nin as plain a manner as possible, those parts of the flower which more\nparticularly constitute this fatal fly trap.On looking into the flower we perceive five Stamina, the Antheræ of\nwhich are large, of a yellow colour, and converge into a kind of cone;\neach of these Antheræ is arrow-shaped, towards the top of the cone their\nsides touch but do not adhere, below they separate a little, so as to\nleave a very narrow opening or slit between each, they are placed on\nvery short filaments, which stand so far apart that a considerable\nopening is left between them, which openings, however, are closed up by\nprocesses of the corolla, nicely adapted to, and projecting into them;\nat the bottom of, and in the very centre of the flower, we perceive two\ngermina, or seed-buds, the rudiments of future seed-vessels, surrounded\nby glandular substances, secreting a sweet liquid; on the summit of\nthese germina, and betwixt the two, stands the stigma, in the form of a\nlittle urn, the middle of which is encircled by a glandular ring, which\nsecretes a viscid honey-like substance, to this part of the stigma the\nAntheræ interiorly adhere most tenaciously, so as to prevent their\nseparation unless considerable force be applied; it is, as we apprehend,\nthe sweet viscid substance thus secreted by the stigma, within the\nAntheræ, which the fly endeavours to obtain, and to this end insinuates\nits trunk first into the lowermost and widest part of the slit, betwixt\neach of the Antheræ above described, pushing it of necessity upwards:\nwhen gratified, not having the sense to place itself in the same\nposition as that in which it stood when it inserted its trunk, and to\ndraw it out in the same direction downwards, unfortunately for it, it\nvaries its position, and pulling its trunk upwards, draws it into the\nnarrow part of the slit, where it becomes closely wedged in, and the\nmore it pulls the more securely it is caught, and thus this heedless\ninsect, as Thomson calls it, terminates its existence in captivity most\nmiserable.In the incomparable poem of Dr. Darwin, entitled the Botanic Garden,\nthere is a figure given of this plant; and in the Supplement we have the\nfollowing account written by Mr. Darwin, of Elston.\"In the Apocynum Androsæmifolium the Anthers converge over the\nnectaries, which consist of five glandular oval corpuscles, surrounding\nthe germ, and at the same time admit air to the nectaries at the\ninterstice between each anther; but when a fly inserts its proboscis\nbetween these anthers to plunder the honey, they converge closer, and\nwith such violence as to detain the fly, which thus generally perishes.\"This explanation of a phænomenon entitled to much attention, is widely\ndifferent from ours; which of the two is most consonant to truth and\nnature, we shall leave to the determination of future observers.In explaining the preceding appearances, to prevent confusion we called\nthose parts which form the cone in the middle of the flower Antheræ, but\nstrictly speaking they are not such, the true Antheræ being situated on\nthe inside of their summits, where they will be found to be ten in\nnumber, making in fact the Apocynum a decandrous plant.","pages":[]},{"latinName":"Class and Order","commonName":"","slug":"class-and-order","volume":1,"sameAs":"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/24670/24670-h/24670-h.htm#Turnera_Angustifolia_Narrow-Leavd_Turnera","image":"class_and_order.jpg","classAndOrder":"Generic Character","genericCharacters":[],"synonyms":[],"description":"This plant here represented is generally known to the Nurserymen about London as the Turnera ulmifolia, or Elm-leav'd Turnera, its foliage\nhowever does not answer to the name, nor to the figures of the plant as\ngiven by Martyn in his Cent.

In 1788, Mr. Walter\npublished his Fl. Carolin. in which he describes a second species\nof Hydrangea, which he calls radiata,[2] having very distinctly,\nas in the Viburnum, two different kinds of florets in\nthe same Cyma, this variation in the florets is added by him to\nthe generic character: the similarity which exists between the\nflowers of Mr. Walter's Hydrangea radiata, and those of the\npresent plant sufficiently justify Dr. Smith in making it an\nHydrangea; the appearances observed by Loureiro[3] on dissecting\nthe germen, and our discovery of the existence of two\ndifferent kinds of flowers in the Hydrangea arborescens, tend\nstill more to confirm its propriety; we may add, that in the very\nhabit of these several plants there exists a considerable similarity;\nstill, however, it is only by ripe seed-vessels of the present plant,\nthat this doubtful matter can be satisfactorily cleared up; but it\nwill not follow, that if it be not an Hydrangea it must be a\nViburnum.This magnificent and highly ornamental plant, according\nto Dr. Smith, was introduced from China to the royal\ngarden at Kew, by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. in 1790; it\nwas imported by Mr. Slater about the same time, with whom\nit is said to have first flowered in this country.If room were allowed us, it would be superfluous to describe\nminutely a plant now so very common; suffice it to\nsay, that from a strong perennial root, rise a number of half-shrubby,\nirregular, somewhat spongy stalks, strongly spotted\nwhen young with purple, from one to three feet high, terminated\nby large bunches of flowers, at first green, then rose-coloured,\nand finally green a second time; these are the most\ncommon changes to which they are liable: but it will sometimes\nhappen that a plant which has produced red flowers\none year, shall produce blue another, though growing in the\nsame pot; this we saw happen in the year 1796 to a plant in\nthe possession of the Countess of Upper Ossory, whose refined\ntaste and superior judgment have in several instances\ncontributed to render our works more acceptable to the\npublic: the coloured changeable part of the flower is regarded\nas the calyx, in the centre of which is the corolla,\ncontaining the stamina, &c. all varying greatly in point of\nnumber; besides these, there are other flowers without any\ncalyx, but the parts which they contain do not seem to be\nmore perfect than those of the others, nor more productive\nof ripe fruit.Since the introduction of this plant, trials have been made\nin regard to its hardiness, and it is found to survive mild winters\nif planted in very warm sheltered situations; but in others,\nboth stalks and leaves are liable to be killed by slight frosts,\nthough the roots are not; if persons are anxious to have it\nin the open border, the best mode will be to cut down the\nstems at the approach of winter, and cover over the root\nwith rotten tan, or some light substance; in the spring fresh\nstalks will shoot forth, but it is more common to keep this\nplant during winter in a green-house or well secured frame;\nby artificial heat it may be brought to flower in April or\nMay, without such, it begins to blossom about June, and continues\nin bloom till October; when successfully treated, it\nwill acquire the height of three feet, and produce bunches\nof flowers supremely magnificent: such plants in pots are admirably\nadapted for decorating court-yards, balconies, &c.\nunless carefully cut in, it is apt to grow too large for the\ngreen-house, therefore it is proper to have a succession of\nyoung plants from cuttings, which strike very freely;
