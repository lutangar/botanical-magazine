          <h2>Preface</h2>
          <p className="initial">
            <span className="first-word">The</span> present periodical publication owes its commencement to the repeated solicitations
            of several Ladies and Gentlemen, Subscribers to the Author's <em>Botanic Garden</em>,
            who were frequently lamenting the want of a work, which might enable them,
            not only to acquire a systematic knowledge of the Foreign Plants growing in their
            gardens, but which might at the same time afford them the best information
            respecting their culture&#8212;in fact, a work, in which Botany and Gardening
            (so far as relates to the culture of ornamental Plants) or the labours of&nbsp;
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"><em>Linn√¶us</em></a> and&nbsp;
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Miller"><em>Miller</em></a>,
            might happily be combined.
          </p>
          <p className="indentation">
            In compliance with their wishes, he has endeavoured to present them with the united
            information of both authors, and to illustrate each by a set of new figures,
            drawn always from the living plant, and coloured as near to nature, as the imperfection
            of colouring will admit.
          </p>
          <p className="indentation">
            He does not mean, however, to confine himself solely to the Plants contained in the
            highly esteemed works of those luminaries of Botany and Gardening,
            but shall occasionally introduce new ones, as they may flower
            in his own garden, or those of the curious in any part of Great-Britain.
          </p>
          <p className="indentation">
            At the commencement of this publication, he had no design of entering on the province
            of the Florist, by giving figures of double or improved Flowers, which sometimes owe
            their origin to culture, more frequently to the sportings of nature;
            but the earnest entreaties of many of his Subscribers, have induced him so far to
            deviate from his original intention, as to promise them one, at least, of the Flowers
            most esteemed by Florists.
          </p>
          <p className="indentation">
            The encouragement given to this work, great beyond the Author's warmest expectations,
            demands his most grateful acknowledgements, and will excite him to persevere in
            his humble endeavours to render Botany a lasting source of rational amusement;
            and public utility.
